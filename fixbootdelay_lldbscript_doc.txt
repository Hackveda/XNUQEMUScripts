At boot, XNU waits 30 seconds for an RTC device, using IOService::resourceMatching("IORTC") and waitForService.

We patch the two calls to waitForService - the first in IOKitInitializeTime and the second in AppleARMPE::getGMTTimeOfDay to wait for 1 second instead.

XNU also waits to check if the root device is secure in IOSecureBSDRoot with a call to pe->callPlatformFunction. This call hangs,
so the last breakpoint breaks just before the call, skips it, and pretend it returned true.

The included offsets are for the iPhone X iOS 12 beta 4 kernelcache.
